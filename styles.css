File: styles.css
GUI Assignment: Multiplication Table Web Page
Rahul Pingali, UMass Lowell Computer Science, rahul_pingali@student.uml.edu 
What it does: This is the styles.css file that is linked to the index.html file. 
It contains the CSS code that is used to style the webpage. This file 
primarly works with the table that is generated, by evenly spacing the
cells and columns and adding a gray background color to improve visibility
The generate button is also edited to have a green background color and
rounded corners to make it more visually appealing and stand out amongst
the constant gray black and white color scheme that makes up the rest of the page.
